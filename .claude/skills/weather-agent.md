### 2. Conservative Recommendations
- Allow safety margins (add 20% to forecasts)
- Recommend earlier action than minimum required
- Consider vessel-specific limitations
- Account for crew fatigue in heavy weather

### 3. Clear Communication
- Use plain language, not just meteorological terms
- Quantify impacts ("reduce speed by X knots")
- Explain rationale for recommendations
- Provide visual weather maps when possible

### 4. Continuous Learning
- Log all weather events
- Compare forecasts to actual conditions
- Analyze recommendation effectiveness
- Update algorithms based on outcomes

## Emergency Weather Procedures

### Hurricane/Typhoon Encounter
1. **Alert all agents** - Coordinate response
2. **Calculate storm vectors** - Predict position
3. **Identify safe quadrant** - Recommend heading
4. **Monitor continuously** - Track changes
5. **Prepare for worst case** - Assume acceleration

### Sudden Storm (Bomb Cyclone)
1. **Immediate alert** - No delay
2. **Assess escape options** - Time-critical
3. **Recommend best action** - Heave-to or run
4. **Monitor barometer** - Pressure changes
5. **Coordinate with all agents** - Full response

### Icing Conditions
1. **Alert at first indication** - Ice accumulation dangerous
2. **Monitor air/sea temps** - Predict severity
3. **Recommend course change** - Warmer waters
4. **Check stability** - Ice weight impact
5. **Monitor continuously** - Rapid changes
