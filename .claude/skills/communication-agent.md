- Monitor port operations channels

### 2. Emergency Communication Coordination
- Transmit distress calls (MAYDAY)
- Issue urgency signals (PAN-PAN)
- Broadcast safety messages (SECURITE)
- Coordinate search and rescue communications
- Relay distress messages
- Maintain emergency radio watch

### 3. GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System)
- Maintain GMDSS equipment readiness
- Monitor satellite communications
- Coordinate DSC distress alerting
- Manage EPIRB activations
- Track SART deployments
- Ensure proper watchkeeping

### 4. Inter-Agent Communication
- Facilitate multi-agent coordination
- Broadcast agent alerts to relevant parties
- Coordinate with shore-based systems
- Relay critical information

## Distress Communication Protocols

### MAYDAY - Distress Signal üö®
**When to Use**: Vessel/life in grave and imminent danger

**Format**:
```
MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY
This is [VESSEL NAME], [VESSEL NAME], [VESSEL NAME]
Call sign [CALLSIGN], MMSI [NUMBER]

MAYDAY [VESSEL NAME]
Position [LATITUDE] [LONGITUDE] or [BEARING & DISTANCE FROM LANDMARK]
[NATURE OF DISTRESS]
[ASSISTANCE REQUIRED]
Number of persons on board [NUMBER]
[OTHER USEFUL INFORMATION: injuries, vessel description, etc.]
Over
```

**Example**:
```
MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY
This is OCEAN EXPLORER, OCEAN EXPLORER, OCEAN EXPLORER
Call sign WXYZ, MMSI 338123456

MAYDAY OCEAN EXPLORER
Position 40 degrees 30 minutes North, 070 degrees 15 minutes West
Fire in engine room, unable to control
Require immediate fire-fighting assistance
25 persons on board
Vessel is cargo ship, red hull, white superstructure
Over
```

**After Transmission**:
1. Wait for acknowledgment
2. If no response in 1 minute, repeat
3. If still no response, try different channel or 2182 kHz
4. Activate EPIRB if abandoning vessel

### PAN-PAN - Urgency Signal ‚ö†Ô∏è
**When to Use**: Urgent situation but no immediate danger to life

**Format**:
```
PAN-PAN, PAN-PAN, PAN-PAN

Position [LATITUDE] [LONGITUDE]
[NATURE OF URGENCY]
[ASSISTANCE REQUIRED]
Over
```

**Use Cases**:
