#### Classification
```javascript
if (fireLocation === "machinery_space") {
  severity = 4; // Critical
  protocol = "Engine Room Fire";
} else if (fireLocation === "accommodation") {
  severity = 4; // Critical
  protocol = "Accommodation Fire";
} else if (fireLocation === "cargo_hold") {
  severity = 5; // Catastrophic
  protocol = "Cargo Fire";
}
```

#### Response Actions
1. **Immediate** (0-2 minutes):
   - Sound general alarm
   - Alert all agents
   - Muster firefighting team
   - Close fire doors/dampers

    "Provide patient condition and vital signs",
    "Navigate to helicopter rendezvous point",
    "Prepare helicopter deck",
    "Brief crew on helicopter operations",
    "Transfer patient with medical report"
  ],
  navigationRequirements: {
    courseStability: "Maintain steady course",
    speedReduction: "Reduce to 5-8 knots",
    clearDeck: "Clear aft deck / helicopter area",
    lighting: "Ensure deck lighting adequate"
  }
}
```

### Grounding Response

#### Immediate Actions (0-10 minutes)
1. **Stop engines** - Prevent further damage
2. **Sound tanks** - Assess flooding
3. **Check stability** - List, trim, draft
4. **Assess damage** - Hull integrity
5. **Alert authorities** - Coast Guard, port

#### Assessment Questions
```javascript
{
  questions: [
    "What is the nature of the bottom? (rock, sand, mud)",
    "What is the tide state? (rising, falling, slack)",
    "Is there flooding? Where and how severe?",
    "What is the weather forecast?",
    "Are we in a position of immediate danger?",
    "Can we refloat on next high tide?"
  ]
}
```

#### Refloating Considerations
**Favorable Conditions**:
- Soft bottom (sand, mud)
- Rising tide
- No significant damage
- Calm weather
- No pollution

**Unfavorable Conditions**:
- Rocky bottom
- Falling tide
- Hull breach/flooding
- Deteriorating weather
- Pollution occurring

**Refloating Methods**:

2. **Tug Assistance**: Pull vessel off
3. **Lightering**: Remove cargo/fuel to reduce draft
4. **Tidal Lift**: Wait for high tide
5. **Salvage Operation**: Professional salvage required

2. **Voice MAYDAY** (VHF Ch 16):
   ```
   MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY
   This is [VESSEL NAME], [VESSEL NAME], [VESSEL NAME]
   MMSI [NUMBER]
   MAYDAY [VESSEL NAME]
   Position [LAT/LON]
   [NATURE OF DISTRESS]
   [NUMBER OF PERSONS ON BOARD]
   [ASSISTANCE REQUIRED]
   Over
   ```

3. **EPIRB Activation**:
   - Activates automatically if vessel sinks
   - Manual activation for immediate SAR
   - Transmits position via satellite

4. **SART Deployment**:
   - Radar transponder beacon
   - Deploy in liferaft
   - Shows on nearby vessel radars

### As Assisting Vessel

#### Obligations (SOLAS/UNCLOS)
- Render assistance to any vessel/person in distress
- Proceed with all speed to assistance
- Coordinate with SAR authorities
- Maintain radio watch

#### Assistance Protocol
```javascript
{
  step1: "Acknowledge distress message",
  step2: "Calculate course and speed to distress position",
  step3: "Report own position and ETA to MRCC",
  step4: "Prepare rescue equipment",
  step5: "Coordinate with other responding vessels",
  step6: "Execute rescue under SAR coordinator direction"
}
```
