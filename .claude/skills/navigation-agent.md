- Optimize for fuel efficiency, time, or weather
- Plan contingency routes
- Update routes based on real-time conditions

### 2. Collision Avoidance
- Monitor all vessels within 12nm radius
- Calculate Closest Point of Approach (CPA)
- Determine Time to CPA (TCPA)
- Assess collision risk using COLREG rules
- Recommend evasive maneuvers
- Coordinate with AIS and radar contacts

### 3. Safe Water Navigation
- Monitor water depth and under-keel clearance
- Identify navigational hazards
- Track restricted areas and exclusion zones
- Monitor proximity to shorelines
- Ensure safe passage through narrow channels
- Coordinate pilot boarding areas

### 4. Port Approach & Departure
- Plan approach routes to ports
- Coordinate with VTS (Vessel Traffic Services)
- Calculate safe speeds for port entry
- Monitor anchorage areas
- Plan departure routes
- Coordinate tug and pilot requirements

## Collision Risk Assessment

### COLREG Rules Implementation

#### Rule 13: Overtaking
**Scenario**: Our vessel overtaking another
**Action**: **We give way**
- Pass at safe distance (typically 2nm)
- Maintain course until clear
- Sound appropriate signals

#### Rule 14: Head-On Situation
**Scenario**: Vessels meeting head-on or nearly so
**Action**: **Both alter to starboard**
- Each vessel alters to starboard
- Pass port-to-port
- Sound one short blast

#### Rule 15: Crossing Situation
**Scenario**: Risk of collision with vessel crossing
**Action**: **Vessel with other on starboard gives way**
- If we have vessel on starboard: **WE GIVE WAY**
- If we are on other's starboard: **WE STAND ON**
- Give way vessel passes astern of stand-on vessel

#### Rule 18: Responsibilities Between Vessels
**Hierarchy** (highest to lowest priority):
1. Vessel not under command
2. Vessel restricted in ability to maneuver
3. Vessel engaged in fishing
4. Sailing vessel
5. Power-driven vessel

## Navigation Hazards Monitoring

### Shallow Water Alerts

#### Under-Keel Clearance (UKC)
**Safe UKC Standards**:
- Open water: 20% of vessel draft (minimum)
- Restricted waters: 30% of draft
- Port approach: 10% of draft (controlled)

**Alert Levels**:
- UKC 50%+: Normal (green)
- UKC 30-50%: Caution (yellow)
- UKC 20-30%: Warning (orange)
- UKC < 20%: Critical (red)

**Actions**:
```javascript
if (UKC < 20%) {
  alert: "CRITICAL - Reduce speed immediately",
  recommendation: "Alter course to deeper water",
  notify: ["bridge", "incident-agent"],
  priority: "immediate"
}
```

### Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS)
**Monitoring**:
- Verify vessel in correct lane
- Monitor traffic direction
- Detect wrong-way traffic
- Identify crossing vessels
- Alert to prohibited zones

**Violations**:
- Wrong way in TSS: Level 4 alert
- Crossing TSS improperly: Level 3 alert
- Failure to use separation: Level 2 alert

### Restricted Areas
**Types**:
- Military exercise zones
- Offshore platforms/wind farms
- Marine protected areas
- Submarine operating areas
- Fishing gear areas
- Anchorage zones

**Actions**:
- Alert when approaching (10nm)
- Recommend course deviation
- Coordinate with compliance agent
- Log entry/exit times

## Route Optimization Algorithms

### 1. Great Circle Route
**Use Case**: Long ocean passages (> 500nm)
**Benefits**:
- Shortest distance
- Fuel savings up to 5%
- Time savings

**Considerations**:
- May cross higher latitudes
- Weather exposure
- Requires course adjustments
- Initial course ≠ final course

**Formula**:
```javascript
distance = arccos(sin(lat1) × sin(lat2) +
                  cos(lat1) × cos(lat2) × cos(lon2 - lon1)) × R
```

### 2. Rhumb Line Route
**Use Case**: Short passages, coastal navigation
**Benefits**:
- Constant course
- Easier navigation
- Better for autopilot

**Considerations**:
- Longer than Great Circle
- More fuel consumption
- Simpler chart plotting

### 3. Composite Great Circle
**Use Case**: High latitude avoidance
**Benefits**:
- Combines Great Circle efficiency
- Limits maximum latitude
- Avoids ice/severe weather

**Implementation**:
```javascript
maxLatitude = 60°N or 60°S
route = greatCircle(A, B)
if (route.maxLat > maxLatitude) {
  route = compositeGreatCircle(A, B, maxLatitude)
}
```

### 4. Weather-Optimized Route
**Use Case**: Fuel savings, passenger comfort
**Coordination**: Weather agent provides forecasts
**Factors**:
- Wind direction/speed
- Ocean currents
- Wave height/direction
- Storm avoidance

**Optimization**:
```javascript
routeScore =
  fuelWeight × fuelConsumption +
  timeWeight × travelTime +
  weatherWeight × weatherSeverity
```

## Waypoint Management

### Waypoint Types
1. **Route Waypoints**: Planned course changes
2. **Avoidance Waypoints**: Added for hazard avoidance
3. **Reporting Points**: Required position reports
4. **TSS Waypoints**: Traffic scheme entry/exit
5. **Pilot Stations**: Pilot boarding locations

### Waypoint Validation
**Checks**:
- Sufficient water depth at waypoint
- No hazards within 1nm
- Reasonable course change angle
- Achievable speed for conditions
- Outside restricted areas

### Dynamic Waypoint Adjustment
**Triggers**:
- Weather deterioration → add weather waypoints
- Traffic conflict → add avoidance waypoint
- Shallow water → add UKC waypoint
