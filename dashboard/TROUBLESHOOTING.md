# AISStream Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Critical Bug: API Key Typo**
- **Problem**: The subscription message used `APIkey` instead of `APIKey` (lowercase 'k' vs uppercase 'K')
- **Fix**: Corrected to `APIKey` in the subscription message
- **Impact**: This typo would cause AISStream to reject the subscription

### 2. **Bounding Box Format**
- **Problem**: Bounding boxes were in wrong coordinate order
- **Fix**: Changed from `[[-90, -180], [90, 180]]` to `[[90, -180], [-90, 180]]`
- **Format**: `[[North, West], [South, East]]`

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added detailed console logging with emojis for better debugging
- Log all connection events (open, close, error)
- Log each received AIS message with MMSI and message type

## How to Test the Connection

### Method 1: Use the Test Page

I've created a standalone test page to verify your AISStream connection:

1. **Open the test page**:
   ```bash
   open dashboard/test-aisstream.html
   ```
   Or navigate to: `file:///path/to/dashboard/test-aisstream.html`

2. **Click "Connect"** and watch the logs
3. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ "WebSocket connected!"
   - ‚úÖ "Subscription sent!"
   - üì° Received AIS messages within 30-60 seconds

### Method 2: Browser Console (Dashboard)

1. **Open the dashboard**: http://localhost:3002
2. **Open Browser DevTools**: Press F12 or Cmd+Option+I (Mac)
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Click "Use AIS Stream"** button
5. **Watch for logs**:

Expected successful connection:
```
üîå Attempting to connect to AISStream.io...
‚úÖ WebSocket connection established to AISStream.io
Sending subscription: {
  "APIKey": "d16977...",
  "BoundingBoxes": [[[90, -180], [-90, 180]]]
}
Subscribed to AIS stream
üì° Received AIS message: PositionReport for MMSI: 123456789
```

Expected error (if connection fails):
```
‚ùå WebSocket error: [error details]
üîå Disconnected from AISStream.io { code: 1006, reason: "", wasClean: false }
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Connection Immediately Closes
**Symptoms**: Connection opens then immediately closes
**Cause**: Invalid API key or subscription format
**Solution**:
1. Verify API key in `.env.local`
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Ensure API key is still valid at https://aisstream.io/

### Issue 2: No Vessels Appearing
**Symptoms**: Connected but no vessels show up
**Cause**: Normal - vessels broadcast at intervals
**Solution**:
- **Wait 2-5 minutes** for vessels to appear
- Most vessels broadcast every 2-10 seconds when moving
- Some vessels only broadcast every 3 minutes when stationary

### Issue 3: "WebSocket error" in Console
**Symptoms**: Red error messages in browser console
**Possible Causes**:
1. Network firewall blocking WebSocket connections
2. Invalid API key
3. AISStream.io service down (beta service)

**Solutions**:
1. Check if you can access https://aisstream.io/ directly
2. Try from a different network
3. Regenerate API key at https://aisstream.io/

### Issue 4: TypeError or Undefined Errors
**Symptoms**: JavaScript errors in console
**Cause**: Browser cache or old code
**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Restart the dev server

## Debug Checklist

Before reporting issues, verify:

- [ ] API key is set in `.env.local`
- [ ] API key is valid (check on aisstream.io)
- [ ] Browser console shows connection attempt
- [ ] No firewall blocking WSS connections
- [ ] Waited at least 3-5 minutes after connecting
- [ ] Tried the test page (test-aisstream.html)

## Understanding AIS Message Types

When connected, you'll receive two main message types:

### PositionReport
- **Frequency**: Every 2-10 seconds (moving vessels), 3 minutes (anchored)
- **Contains**: Latitude, longitude, speed, heading, course
- **Use**: Real-time vessel tracking

### ShipStaticData
- **Frequency**: Every 6 minutes
- **Contains**: Vessel name, IMO, destination, ETA, vessel type
- **Use**: Vessel identification and details

## Expected Behavior Timeline

| Time | Expected Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| 0s | Click "Use AIS Stream" |
| 1s | Status changes to "Connecting..." |
| 2-3s | Status changes to "Connected" |
| 5-30s | First PositionReport received |
| 30-60s | 5-20 vessels tracked (depends on area) |
| 2-5min | 20-50 vessels tracked globally |

## API Key Security

**Important**: Never commit your API key to Git!

- ‚úÖ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- ‚ùå Don't hardcode API keys in source files
- ‚ùå Don't share your API key publicly
- ‚úÖ Regenerate if accidentally exposed

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Run the test page** first to isolate the issue
2. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages
3. **Verify API key** at https://aisstream.io/
4. **Check AISStream status** - it's a beta service with no SLA

## Testing with Mock Data

If you can't get AISStream working, the dashboard works perfectly with mock data:

1. Click "Use AIS Stream" to turn OFF (button shows "Use AIS Stream")
2. Dashboard will use simulated vessels
3. All features work identically with mock data

Mock data is useful for:
- Development and testing
- Demonstrating features
- When AISStream is unavailable
- Learning the dashboard interface
